VKDump
======

Handy tool to dump media content from social network Vkontakte. It uses the OAuth 2.0 open protocol, users do not send their login and password so accounts can not be compromised. 

Getting ready
-------------

In order to use it first you have to create a Vkontakte application. Follow [this](https://vk.com/editapp?act=create) link and type whatever title for an application (ie. **vkdump**), Select **Standalone** as **Platform**, and pass mobile device linkage process (just follow all the instructions proposed by Vkontakte). After that go to **Settings** tab, copy and store somewhere the numeric value for the **Application ID** setting (it will be necessary for a dumper), in combo box **Application status** choose **Application on and visible to all** and click on **Save** button.
